Logic behind placing elements:

Foundations - our lovely, little, quarks. Fonts, colors, etc.

Atomic (single) - simplest element, used to build Molecular (e.g. image, text, input)

Molecular (component) - view element composed from Atomics, 
                      - Should have 2 or more Atomics, otherwise it's an Atomic,
                      - used to build Views (e.g. row, tabbar, navbar, list)
